In this file, the detail of the ugv_master package is given.

1. Sensor
   In this level, the lms151, velodyne64 and velodyne32 data are generated.

   "Velodyne64 needs to be generated by the old stable version"

2. Transform

   In this level,

   Road_detection is used to estimate the plane and object model by RANSAC.

   Lidar_odometry is used here to work as a fixed tool when the GPS is down.

   Object_detection is used here to estimate the positive and negative object.


3. Mapping

   In this level,

   Robot_center_mapping is taken to model the road structure, while the object
   structure could also be added on the plane level.

   Map_segmenter is used to estimate the road tree by using image thinning and MST
   algorithm.


   Map_replanner is used to fix the problem with GPS jumping and road junctions, the
   aim of this module is to give a good map target based on current map and mission
   targets.


4. Planning

   In this level,

   Local_planner is the main planner module that generate the potential Bezair curve
   and estimate each curve based on its "carvaniance", "distance", "travel cost", and
   give the based curve based on these cost function.
